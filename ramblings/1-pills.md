# pills

*february 27, 2023*

sometimes, before i go to sleep, i fantasize. i sometimes wish there were a pill that would let me pause time for as long as i wanted.

as my body drifts toward slumber, my mind races as i picture all of the great things i could do if i could just pause time, indefinitely. maybe i'd catch up on all of my assignments. after that, maybe i'd do all the things i swore i'd do if i had the time: learn something new on my own, read some books i'd earmarked, and work on a website i promised to build as a favor.

there's another pill i sometimes wish i could have: one that would give me all knowledge. i think about this one i'm out and about, going about my day, attending classes and seminars, studying, reading. it's these times when i most greatly feel a sense of confinement by the things i don't already know or understand.

unfortunately (and obviously), there is no such pill. there's not even a pill like the one in [_limitless_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitless_(film)) that allows for superhuman cognition.

but there are pills. pills to make you think faster. pills to make you stronger, more resilient. pills to correct nutrient deficiencies or chemical imbalances. pills to make you rainbow-shitting, [mariokart-starman](https://mariokart.fandom.com/wiki/Starman) euphoric. pills to simply make you feel better.

i've thought a lot about these sorts of pills, the real equivalent of these fantasy drugs i long dreamed of. adderall, dextroamphetamine, caffeine. some of them aren't drugs *per se*, and some aren't even pills. n-acetyl l-tyrosine, l-theanine, creatine, ashwagandha, tongkat ali, ostarine, ibutamoren, RAD-140.

the way i see it, none of these drugs or supplements will truly solve any of the issues i've been facing. the good news is that i don't need a pill to pause time. if i really need a break, i could take a leave of absence for a quarter, during which time i could do everything i would want to if i could pause time: learn, exercise, reflect, rejuvenate.

that said, i don't think i'll do that just yet. i have unfinished business on campus. that is to say that i feel a responsibility to myself to finish the year on a positive note:

I CAN DO IT. i'm trying to turn it into a mantra for myself. because it's true. I CAN DO IT. and not just me: as difficult as it may be, i know that everyone here is capable of success, even if that outcome requires extra care and support, which everyone deserves.

somehow, i'm simultaneously optimistic, pessimistic, and resigned with regard to the rest of the year. while i know that adjusting lifestyle factors, living situation, and course load will help me manage my stress and keep me happy, i don't know if it'll really fix anything in the long term. i've already made a few such changes this quarter, and it hasn't helped a great deal. with any luck, though, next quarter will be brighter and happier.

## thanks
