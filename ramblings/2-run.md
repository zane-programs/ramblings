## run?

sometimes i want to just run.

every so often, i think about leaving this place and not coming back for a kittle while. if i could just walk away without consequence and just breathe, i probably would. i could take some time to collect myself, to catalog and acknowledge my feelings, to find and appreciate the intrinsic appeal of the things i once enjoyed.

in this time away, i'd still seek out something productive, something useful. whether or not this fantasy hypothetical necessitates income, i think i'd want to do some kind of work. would it be software development again? maybe. as long as it's something that gives me the space to reflect on my experiences thus far and come back even stronger.

## maybe not

maybe i don't have to run. i think i can do what i want to do, what i need to do, without leaving. but in order to do that, i'll need to commit to:

1. **mindfulness.** i don't do it enough and it's been so helpful. yesterday, i had an opportunity to lead a short meditation in one of my classes, and it helped me a lot in feeling better about what lay ahead of me for the rest of the day.
2. **distance.** i have to maintain proper distance between myself and the people and things i interact with on a daily basis. i should keep my distance from the things that cause me stress but move closer to those that keep me calm and balanced.
3. **self-care** in general. continuing to eat, sleep, and exercise in addition to everything else. these will remain important even as circumstances change.
4. **gratitude.** maybe my favorite on this list. it's easy to forget how lucky i am to have everything that i do: a roof over my head, food to eat, and opportunities to better and balance myself every day, inside and out. beyond that, there are so many people i'm grateful for. why not start by enumerating *some* of them (in no particular order)?
    - my family. i know i'm in your thoughts, and you are always in mine <3 love you
    - my friends back home. truly appreciate you for sticking around
        - shoutout to lawrence and verda tbh
    - everyone in fleet street (rage & love ya)
        - and thank you to rose for hearing me out and suggesting helpful ideas for the future
    - my professors, lecturers, and TAs who work so hard to help me learn and succeed
    - dr. eastman
    - the people who work in the dining halls here (inspiringly kind and hardworking)
        - ricker!! chris, mirsada, hector, and everyone else
    - petra
    - the SLC
    - the swallows team (and all honorary members). u know who u are
    - stanford in general. as difficult as things can feel here sometimes, i have to give this place credit for recognizing that and providing students with mechanisms to improve and balance themselves.

## what now?

we wait and see. maybe this does something, or maybe it doesn't. beyond what i'm able to solve on my own, i've reached out for the support available to me, and with any luck that'll materialize soon.

like before, i'm cautiously optimistic.

## thanks

i hope you got something out of reading this. if you did (or if you didn't), [let me know](mailto:hey@zanestjohn.com?subject=ramblings%20-%20run); i would be interested in hearing what you have to say, no matter how you feel.
